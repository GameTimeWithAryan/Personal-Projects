# Improvements

`IMPROVEMENTS.md` contains a list of all the projects I have created over time and published to
GitHub. It also highlights some of the upsides and downsides of the code I wrote.
This is based on my current understanding of software design and coding practices.
They may change for me in the future as I learn more and understand how shitty my code was
:stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:. The projects are listed in ascending order of creation date.
